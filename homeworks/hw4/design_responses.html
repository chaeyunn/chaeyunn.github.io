						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>Overall, I gained a lot of resources from this aritcle in order to make my designs more accessible. 
								I also learned about the W3C's minimum AA rating which is at least 4.5:1. Knowing this allows me to 
								look out for aspects in my future web designs that I would have never thought about.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of this article were the various resources that the writer gave for me to reference in the future.
								For example, Colorable and Colorsafe are wbesites I had never heard about until now. Another part about the article I appreciated were the examples given that help designs become more accessible outside of color such as iconography.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p>"When displaying things like graphs or charts, giving users the option to add texture or patterns ensures that those who are colorblind can distinguish between them without having to worry about color affecting their perception of the data."</p>
