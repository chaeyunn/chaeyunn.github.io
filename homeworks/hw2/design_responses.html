					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>One thing I learned from this article was the reasoning behind the rise of motion in design. With the constant decrease of attention span in consumers, companies are doing everything they can to 
								keep their audience engaged. I also learned the attractiveness of high contrast design.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>My favorite part of this article was the visuals that went along with the various design choices website developers make. For example, when glassmorphism and claymorphism are mentioned, it was 
								nice to see an example of this. I also really appreciated the organization of the article. Everything was nicely categorized so that I can easily understand the main points.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> " I’ve also noticed that elements with crystal or pearl-lookalike effect are becoming quite the thing. 
								I think it’s reasonable to put it under one label — it just seems that the overall real-life materials 
								imitation is a strong trend in the recent years, and it’s not coming to an end anytime soon." </p>
						</li>
