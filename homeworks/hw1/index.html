        <p>Hi! My name is Chae Won and I am really interested in UI/UX studying data science and design innovation at UC Berkeley. Outside of classes, I like to going on picnics, painting, and wheel
            throwing to create ceramic pieces.</p>

                <li>1. Something I learned from this article was how intentional eveything is when it comes to the layout and design of a platform. I found it interesting that the author of this article pointed out specifics 
                    such as the Twitter retweets and like numbers being bolded that I had not realized was intentional.</li>
                <li>2. My favorite part of the article were the examples given for very well-known platforms including Airbnb and Spotify. These visual examples helped me to realize how much work goes into the layout of the platforms.</li>
                <li>3. "Someone had to map out all of the content use cases and decide on the appropriate subheaders to pair with them."</li>
                <li>4. 7</li>
